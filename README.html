                <p>King Midas was obsessed with gold. He spent his days counting his treasury, wishing he had more. One day, a satyr granted him a wish: <span class="highlight">everything he touched would turn to gold</span>.</p>
                <p>Midas was ecstatic! He ran through his palace, turning tables, chairs, and even a statue into shimmering gold. He was the richest man in the world!</p>`,
                right: `<p>But the joy was short-lived. When he tried to eat, his food turned to gold. His glass of water turned to gold. He could no longer eat or drink.</p>
                <p>The true tragedy struck when his beloved daughter, Zoe, rushed in to hug him. In an instant, she became a beautiful, <span class="emphasis">lifeless gold statue</span>.</p>

                right: `<p>Midas rushed to the river and plunged his hands in. The power flowed out of him, turning the river's sands golden. He ran back to the palace, where Zoe was waiting, no longer a statue, but his living, laughing daughter.</p>
                <p>From that day on, King Midas cherished simple things and never wished for gold again. The River Pactolus still holds a memory of his wish, glittering with <span class="highlight">golden sands</span> as a testament to the King's life-changing mistake.</p>
